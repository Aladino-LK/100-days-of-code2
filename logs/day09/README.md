## Exercises
### Excercise 1 - Grading Program
**Instructions:**
- You have access to a database of `student_scores` in the format of a dictionary. The keys in `student_scores` are the **names of the students** and the values are their **exam scores**.
- Write a program that converts their scores to grades. 
- By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called `student_grades` that should contain **student names** for keys and their **grades** for values. 
- DO NOT write any print statements.

This is the scoring criteria:

```
Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"

Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"

Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"

Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"
```

**Output Expected:**
```
'{'Harry': 'Exceeds Expectations', 'Ron': 'Acceptable', 'Hermione': 'Outstanding', 'Draco': 'Acceptable', 'Neville': 'Fail'}'
```

**Code**

<p>

```Python
student_scores = {
  "Harry": 81,
  "Ron": 78,
  "Hermione": 99, 
  "Draco": 74,
  "Neville": 62,
}
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#TODO-1: Create an empty dictionary called student_grades.
student_grades = {}

#TODO-2: Write your code below to add the grades to student_grades.ðŸ‘‡
student = ""
for student in student_scores:
    score = student_scores[student] 
    if score <= 70:
        student_grades[student] = "Fail"
    elif score <= 80:
        student_grades[student] = "Acceptable"
    elif score <= 90:
        student_grades[student] = "Exceeds Expectations"
    elif score >= 91:
        student_grades[student] = "Outstanding"
   
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
print(student_grades)
```

### Excercise 2 - Dictionary in List
**Instructions:**
- Write a program that adds to a `travel_log`. 
- The `travel_log` is a **List** that contains **2 Dictionaries**.
- Write a function that will work with the following line of code to add the entry for Russia to the travel_log.

```
add_new_country("Russia", 2, ["Moscow", "Saint Petersburg"])
```
- You've visited Russia 2 times.
- You've been to Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
- DO NOT modify the travel_log directly. 
- Create a function that modifies it.


**Code**

```Python
travel_log = [
{
  "country": "France",
  "visits": 12,
  "cities": ["Paris", "Lille", "Dijon"]
},
{
  "country": "Germany",
  "visits": 5,
  "cities": ["Berlin", "Hamburg", "Stuttgart"]
},
]
#ðŸš¨ Do NOT change the code above

#TODO: Write the function that will allow new countries
#to be added to the travel_log. ðŸ‘‡
def add_new_country(country_visited, times_visited, cities_visited):
    new_country = {}
    new_country["country"] = country_visited
    new_country["visits"] = times_visited
    new_country["cities"] = cities_visited 
    travel_log.append(new_country)

#ðŸš¨ Do not change the code below
add_new_country("Russia", 2, ["Moscow", "Saint Petersburg"])
print(travel_log)
```
