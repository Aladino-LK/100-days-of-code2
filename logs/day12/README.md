## Objectives

<p>

1. Import modules

2. Create constants for the number of lives left based on the difficulty selected

8. Define a function that will take user's input 'easy' or 'hard'
 to return the appropriate constant as output which can be stored in a variable within another function
 This function's output will either be a 10 or a 5
 Based on the difficulty function will set the number of lives
   

13. Define a function to check the user's guess with the generated number and subtract a life if 
 the guess is not equal to the generated number to set it as the return value to keep track in the
 game's while loop
   

3. Define game function
4. Print the game's logo, welcome, and number guessing range

5. Create a variable to store a randomly generated number

6. Print generated number for testing purposes

7. Ask the player for the desired difficulty to store the number of lives
 in a variable that can be modified depending on number of tries left
   Because this function will output a 10 or a 5 (number of lives based on difficulty)
   the output needs to be stored in a variable in order for it to be used or modified later on

9. The game will continue until the number is guessed correctly unless the lives run out first.
   There is no guess yet so there is an empty 'guess' variable to start.
  
10. Start by keeping track of the remaining attempts in the game.

11. Ask user for an integer input
 
    
12. Keep track of the number of lives by checking the result of the guess 

14. Player will be notified if the lives have run out and game will end via return statement.
     Otherwise it will prompt the player to guess again and while loop will restart as long as 
     guess number is not equal to the generated number
   
15. Call the game function to run the program
